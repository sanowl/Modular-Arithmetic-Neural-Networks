## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use neural networks to perform modular arithmetic tasks. The models are trained on synthetic datasets and evaluated on real-world arithmetic datasets from Hugging Face.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/modular-arithmetic-neural-networks.git
cd modular-arithmetic-neural-networks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Logging

You can also install the dependencies directly:

```bash
pip install torch numpy datasets transformers
```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python modular_arithmetic.py
```

This will initialize, train, and evaluate the neural network models for both modular addition and multiplication tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "math_dataset" from Hugging Face, which contains various mathematical problems. The dataset is filtered and adapted to create training samples for modular addition and multiplication tasks.

## Model

The `ModularArithmeticNet` class defines a neural network model that can be used for either modular addition or multiplication. The model is initialized with specific parameters and weights are set according to the modular arithmetic task.

## Training and Evaluation

The script includes functions to train and evaluate the models:

- `train_model`: Trains the model using the provided data loader.
- `evaluate_model`: Evaluates the model and computes accuracy using Hugging Face's `load_metric`.

## Results

After running the script, the training progress and evaluation results will be logged to the console. You can observe the loss reduction during training and the final accuracy of the models.
